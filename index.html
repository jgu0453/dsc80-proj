        <h2>Assessment of Missingness</h2>
        
        <!-- First Image: Missingness Overview -->
        <div class="plot-container">
            <h3>Missingness Overview</h3>
            <img src="missing.png" alt="Overview of Missingness">
        </div>
        
        <p>The column <strong>"gold_per_minute"</strong> in the dataset is suspected to be <strong>NMAR</strong> (Not Missing At Random). This is because missing values in this column may depend on the game’s completeness. Specifically, incomplete games or games with early terminations could lead to missing values in the <strong>"gold_per_minute"</strong> metric. For instance, if a match ends before reaching certain key timestamps, there may be insufficient data to calculate this feature, resulting in missing values.</p>
        
        <p>To investigate this further, we performed a missingness dependency test, analyzing whether the missingness of the <strong>"gold_per_minute"</strong> column depends on the game length. The test statistic and p-value help assess the relationship between the missingness of this column and the <strong>"gamelength"</strong> feature.</p>
    
        <div class="plot-container">
            <h3>Permutation Test for Missingness</h3>
            
            <p>The observed test statistic and the p-value indicate a significant relationship between missingness and game length. Specifically, a p-value of 0.0 suggests that the missingness of <strong>"gold_per_minute"</strong> is strongly dependent on the <strong>"gamelength"</strong> feature, reinforcing the hypothesis that the missing data may be NMAR.</p>

        </div>
    </section>
    
    <section id="hypothesis-test">
        <h2>Hypothesis Test: Team Performance Analysis</h2>
        
        <h3>Null and Alternative Hypotheses</h3>
        <p><strong>Null Hypothesis (H₀):</strong> There is no significant difference in the win rates between the different teams.</p>
        <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):</strong> There is a significant difference in the win rates between the different teams.</p>
        
        <h3>Test Statistic</h3>
        <p>To test these hypotheses, we performed a one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test, which compares the mean win rates across multiple teams. The test statistic is an F-statistic, which measures the variance between group means relative to the variance within the groups.</p>
    
        <h3>Test Results</h3>
        <p>The result of the ANOVA test is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>F-statistic:</strong> 24.71</li>
            <li><strong>p-value:</strong> 0.0</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The p-value is extremely small (0.0), which suggests that there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there are significant differences in the win rates between the teams.</p>
        
        <h3>LPL vs. LDL Performance</h3>
        <p>We also compared the win rates of two specific leagues: LPL and LDL. The win rates for both leagues are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>LPL:</strong> 0.5</li>
            <li><strong>LDL:</strong> 0.5</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Interestingly, both leagues have the same win rate of 0.5, suggesting no significant difference in performance between the two leagues based on this metric.</p>
    
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Based on the ANOVA test, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in win rates among the teams in the dataset. However, when comparing LPL and LDL, there is no observable difference in win rates, as both leagues have identical performance metrics.</p>

    <section id="prediction-problem">
        <h2>Framing Prediction Problem</h2>
        <p>The problem we are addressing is a binary classification task. The goal is to predict whether a professional League of Legends team will win or lose a match based on various in-game performance metrics and events up to a certain point in the match. The response variable for this problem is <strong>result</strong>, where a win is labeled as 1 and a loss is labeled as 0. We chose this variable because it directly captures the outcome of the game and aligns with our goal of understanding the factors contributing to victory in competitive matches.</p>
        <p><strong>Evaluation Metric:</strong> To evaluate our model, we use accuracy as the primary performance metric. Accuracy was chosen because our dataset has a relatively balanced distribution of wins and losses, making it a suitable metric for measuring overall performance. However, if class imbalance were present, we would also consider metrics such as F1-score to account for both precision and recall. Accuracy provides a straightforward way to assess how well the model predicts the correct outcomes, which aligns with our objective of understanding win predictors.</p>
        <p><strong>Features and Time of Prediction:</strong> When selecting features for the model, we ensured that all the features used for prediction are available at the time of prediction during a match. Specifically, we used the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Numerical Features:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>goldat15:</strong> Total gold earned by the team at 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>gold_diff_per_minute:</strong> The gold difference per minute between the team and their opponent.</li>
                    <li><strong>KDA:</strong> Kill-death-assist ratio, a performance metric reflecting player effectiveness.</li>
                    <li><strong>gold_share:</strong> Proportion of the total gold earned by the team.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Categorical Features:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>pick1, pick2, pick3, pick4, pick5:</strong> Champions picked by the team during the draft phase.</li>
                    <li><strong>firstblood:</strong> Indicator of whether the team secured the first kill.</li>
                    <li><strong>firstdragon:</strong> Indicator of whether the team secured the first dragon.</li>
                    <li><strong>firstherald:</strong> Indicator of whether the team secured the first Rift Herald.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These features are carefully chosen to ensure they reflect in-game actions and states that occur before the match outcome is determined. For example, champion picks are decided during the draft phase, and early-game events such as securing the first blood or first dragon happen early in the match. These features allow the model to make predictions based on information that would be known at the time of prediction, maintaining the integrity and real-world applicability of our analysis.</p>
        <p>By carefully constructing the model and evaluation pipeline, we aim to provide actionable insights into the key factors that influence a team's success in professional League of Legends matches.</p>

    <section id="baseline-model">
        <h2>Baseline Model</h2>
        
        <h3>Model Overview</h3>
        <p>The baseline predictive model aims to predict the match result based on several features. The model is built using logistic regression, a simple and interpretable classifier. The features included in the model are:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> 1 feature - "goldat15" (gold earned at 15 minutes).</li>
            <li><strong>Nominal:</strong> 6 features - "pick1", "pick2", "pick3", "pick4", "pick5" (champion picks for the game), and binary outcomes for "firstblood", "firstdragon", and "firstherald" (whether the team secured the first blood, first dragon, or first herald).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Feature Preprocessing</h3>
        <p>We applied the following preprocessing steps to prepare the data for modeling:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We dropped any rows with missing values in the selected feature columns.</li>
            <li>We encoded categorical features (e.g., champion picks and first objectives) using one-hot encoding to transform them into binary columns.</li>
            <li>The numerical feature ("goldat15") was standardized to have zero mean and unit variance using the StandardScaler.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Model Performance</h3>
        <p>The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. The performance of the model was assessed using accuracy and a classification report. The results are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 0.69</li>
            <li><strong>Classification Report:</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <pre>
            precision    recall  f1-score   support
    
               0       0.69      0.71      0.70      1699
               1       0.69      0.68      0.69      1673
    
        accuracy                           0.69      3372
        macro avg       0.69      0.69      0.69      3372
        weighted avg    0.69      0.69      0.69      3372
        </pre>
    
        <h3>Interpretation of Model Performance</h3>
        <p>The baseline model achieved an accuracy of 0.69, which indicates that it correctly predicts the match result 69% of the time. The classification report further reveals that the model performs equally well in predicting both classes (team winning or losing), with similar precision, recall, and f1-scores for both classes. Specifically, class 0 (team winning) has a precision of 0.69, recall of 0.71, and an f1-score of 0.70, while class 1 (team losing) has a precision of 0.69, recall of 0.68, and an f1-score of 0.69.</p>
    
        <h3>Is the Model Good?</h3>
        <p>Given the accuracy and balanced performance across both classes, the baseline model provides a reasonable performance. While the accuracy is fairly good, there is still room for improvement. The model's performance could benefit from exploring more advanced algorithms, adding additional features, or tuning the hyperparameters to increase the accuracy further.</p>
    
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>While the baseline logistic regression model offers a solid starting point, it can be enhanced with more features and other machine learning techniques to improve its prediction accuracy and robustness.</p>
