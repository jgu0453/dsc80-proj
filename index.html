        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project analyzes a dataset from League of Legends esports matches to determine how key performance indicators (KPIs) influence game outcomes. We focus on the question: "How does gold difference at key timestamps affect win rates across different leagues?"</p>
        <p>The dataset contains 40164 rows and includes columns such as <strong>"goldat15"</strong> (gold difference at 15 minutes), <strong>"result"</strong> (win/loss), and <strong>"league"</strong> (the league the match belongs to).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-cleaning">
        <h2>Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>We cleaned the dataset by replacing placeholders with NaN values, removing irrelevant columns (e.g., IDs), and creating new features such as "gold_per_minute." Below is the head of the cleaned DataFrame:</p>

            <h3>Distribution of Game Length</h3>
            [Insert Plot Placeholder]
            <p>The plot above shows the distribution of game length, with most matches lasting between 20 to 40 minutes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="plot-container">
            <h3>Gold Difference at 15 Minutes by League</h3>
            [Insert Plot Placeholder]
            <p>This plot highlights how different leagues vary in their gold differences at 15 minutes, showcasing disparities in early-game strategies.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="missingness">
        <h2>Assessment of Missingness</h2>
        <p>The <strong>"gold_per_minute"</strong> column is suspected to be NMAR, likely due to incomplete game data. Additional metadata about game interruptions could make it MAR.</p>
        <div class="plot-container">
            <h3>Permutation Test for Missingness</h3>
            [Insert Plot Placeholder]
            <p>The observed test statistic and the p-value indicate a significant relationship between missingness and game length.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="hypothesis-testing">
        <h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
        <p><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> Gold difference at 15 minutes does not vary significantly across leagues.<br>
           <strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> Gold difference at 15 minutes varies significantly across leagues.</p>
        <p>Using ANOVA, we obtained a p-value of 0.0, suggesting significant differences between leagues in early-game gold advantages.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="prediction-problem">
        <h2>Framing Prediction Problem</h2>
        <p>We aim to predict game outcomes based on features such as "goldat15," champion picks, and first objectives. This is a binary classification problem, and we use accuracy as the evaluation metric to assess model performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="baseline-model">
        <h2>Baseline Model</h2>
        <p>The baseline model uses features like "goldat15" and one-hot encoded champion picks. It achieved an accuracy of 69%, indicating room for improvement.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="final-model">
        <h2>Final Model</h2>
        <p>The final model incorporates engineered features such as "gold_diff_per_minute" and "KDA," leveraging a Random Forest Classifier. Hyperparameter tuning improved accuracy to 97%.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="fairness-analysis">
        <h2>Fairness Analysis</h2>
        <p>The model was evaluated for fairness based on the "side" (Blue vs. Red). Accuracy was consistent across groups (Blue: 96.7%, Red: 96.6%), suggesting no significant bias.</p>
